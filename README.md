Paper Title: "RBFNN-Enabled Diffusion Learning Over Complex Networks In Intricate Environments"

Abstract:
This repository contains the numerical simulation code for the paper, including two main experiments:
1. Performance Comparison Between Competing Algorithms
2. Justification of Different Numbers of Gaussian RBF
   
These experiments are organized into two separate folders, named Simulation1 and Simulation2, respectively.  Each folder contains a main script as the primary function for executing the simulations.

Additionally, the repository includes experimental code designed to facilitate a deeper understanding of concepts proposed in other related papers, serving as a valuable reference for further research.

For detailed parameter settings, please refer to the original paper.

Running Environment:
All simulations were conducted using MATLAB 2024b.

Thank you for your patience and interest in our work!
